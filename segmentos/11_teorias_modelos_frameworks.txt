• Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF)
• Health Belief Model
• Theory of Planned Behavior
• Self-Determination Theory (SDT)
• Self-Efficacy Theory
• Transtheoretical Model
• Social Cognitive Theory (SCT)

• Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share (IDEAS)
• Agile Methods
• 5-D Cycle (Define, Discover, Dream, Design, and Deliver)
• Contextual Design
• Behavior-Centered Design Process
• CeHRes Roadmap
• Requirement Development Approach
• START (Screen, Triangulate, Analyze, Redesign, and Test) Process
• Formative Research Process
• Iterative Convergent Mixed Methods Design Process
• Participatory Action Research (PAR) Process

• PRECEDE PROCEED Model
• Stanford Persuasive Design Model

* The lists above are not meant to be exhaustive of all the theories, models and frameworks studies drew from. The theories, models and frameworks cited above are representative of what was explicitly mentioned and clearly described by studies. Studies often elected to draw on broad literature reviews, group brainstorming, practice guidelines, user feedback and other methods to conceptualize, identify, evaluate, and guide their work. The categories presented here (conceptualize, identify, evaluate and guide) are also not meant to be mutually exclusive. While overlap exists between these classifications, conceptualizing the differences between certain types of theories, models and frameworks can help facilitate selection of tools to guide mHealth DBCI design. More information on the approaches and methods studies used throughout mHealth DBCI design can be seen in Appendix 4).
