Conclusion
The number of mHealth interventions designed to support
behavior change is increasing. Integrating best practices from
BD and DT may allow for the development of mHealth DBCIs
that more effectively engage patients and the public. This paper
has helped identify and conceptualize the methods that can be
used to integrate BD and DT throughout the mHealth DBCI
design process. Raising the standard of mHealth design methods
will be essential to ensure confidence in the impact mHealth
interventions can have on improving health outcomes. If more
mHealth DBCIs are purposefully designed to address effective
engagement, it is likely that patients, the public, and health care
practitioners will be more confident in adopting mHealth. Given
the predicted increase in the demand of mHealth interventions,
the time is now to ensure mHealth design methods are
appropriately suited to increase effective engagement.
